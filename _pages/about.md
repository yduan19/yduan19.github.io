I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Truveta, where I develop Large Language Models for clinical note extraction and healthcare AI applications. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University, focusing on computational modeling of complex fluids and granular materials.

My work bridges multiple disciplines, mathematics, physics, machine learning, and high-performance computing, to solve challenging problems at the intersection of scientific computing and artificial intelligence. I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge ML techniques to accelerate scientific discovery and save lives through data and machine learning.
